# weather-app
A simple mobile web app for getting the current weather of chosen locations around the world.

## How to View
- You can check out the web app [live on Heroku](https://how-is-the-weather.herokuapp.com/).
- I highly encourage you to give it a try using your mobile device so you can view the app as it was intended to be, if instead you are using your desktop hit `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`I` then `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`M` to go on mobile mode.
- Allow access to current location in order to get the current weather in your location on start up.

## Features
- Use the search to find out the current weather at a city of your choice.
- Tap the pin icon to save a city so it will persist on refresh.
- Remove a city from the list by tapping the X icon.
- Tap the refresh icon at the bottom left of the current weather window to get the latest weather data, either way it will automatically refresh every 20 mins.
